# bstSpeedBenchmark
A program to compare the speed of Binary Search Tree to buit-in list.

## Sample output:
```
10 000 random word searches.
(max sample capacity is 900 due to recursion)
-- Python's list: 0.07 seconds.
-- Binary Search Tree(built on consecutive item addition): 0.91 seconds.
-- BST(built on random item addition): 0.03 seconds.
-- Balanced BST: 0.02 seconds.
```
